# Loggr.sh

Loggr.sh is a social platform for indie hacker and (or) product builder to share their journeys with the same minded people.

Basically it's a journal application with social interactions like liking, following and commenting. It's built using Laravel and React. This was my first time using Laravel, that's why code is so bad.

To be honest, I really don't remember a lot about the code. Because of that, I will not write a lot in here. But, there is some Tweets (or Posts in X) about this project.
